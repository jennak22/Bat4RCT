# Bat4RCT: A suite of benchmark data and baseline methods for text classification of randomized controlled trials
A repository of dataset and source code for the publication paper of RCT classification research 

## How to use files  
1. To get the results described in the paper, all the code was implemented on Python 3.9.16. To run the code, make sure that all packages in 'requirements.txt' file are installed. You can install them using pip. Type the following command in the terminal or command prompt: 
                
                pip install -r requirements.txt 

2. Download and unzip "rct_data.zip" file. You can find "rct_data.txt" file that is the RCT dataset used in the paper. 
 
3. Open the jupyter notebook ("Bat4RCT_Main.ipynb") in your machine or a cloud computing platform you use. Place "rct_data.txt" and "modules.py" files in the same directory where the jupyter notebook is located. 

4. Detailed instruction on how to run each model is described in the notebook.

5. Also, you can use a python file ("bat4rct_main.py") instead of the jupyter notebook to run the same models.
